            <p class="my-10 text-xl lg:text-2xl">Since 2015 I have helped brands break marketing barriers online and engineered infrastructure at a massive scale in big tech.</p>

            <p class="my-6">In 2021 I shifted my focus to fashion design, while continuing to craft modern digital experiences for select clients on the web.</p>

            <p class="my-6">From high-traffic online magazines to elegant storytelling and e-commerce, my website and app development work has won awards and elevated clients to new heights. As a result I have gained a fine-tuned skillset and forged strong relationships with some of the best builders across many industries.</p>

            <p class="my-6">My mission now is to utilize this network of creatives and expertise in modern technology to bring impossible visions into reality.</p>

            <p class="my-6">I'm doing this for myself with the launch of my fashion label, Sam Rapaport, and happily engaging with select clientele that have similar trajectories.</p>
