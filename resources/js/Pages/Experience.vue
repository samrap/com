                        As we began coming out of the pandemic I found myself questioning the type of work and lifestyle
                        that I was looking for. I left my role at Stripe to move closer to family and help other
                        businesses grow by combining my professional network with my unique development and design skills.
                    </p>

                    <p class="mb-6 text-xl leading-loose">
                        Since then, I have built relationships with clients large and small on both short and
                        long term development projects. From doubling MRR for <a href="https://quillette.com">Quillette</a>
                        over the last 12 months to launching brands like <a href="https://playersonlyholdings.com/">Chris Webber's Capital Venture</a>
                        and <a href="https://fiveninesclo.com">Five Nines</a>, I've gained immense experience in
                        business development, account management, and team management, while continuing to utilize and
                        develop my skills in technology.
                    </p>

                    <p class="mb-6 text-xl leading-loose">
                        Having the freedom to scope every project myself, I have stuck to what I believe to be the best
                        technologies for the job. Working primarily with Laravel, VueJS, and TailwindCSS, I have also
                        launched projects built with Nuxt, and engineered high-assurance infrastructure on AWS using
                        Terraform for clients with high traffic sites.

                        Engineer on the infrastructure and services for Stripe's customer-facing edge and secure
                        cardholder data environment. This high-assurance system proxies all customer traffic, tokenizes
                        and stores sensitive payment card data, and interconnects with financial partners.

                    <p class="mb-6 text-xl leading-loose">
                        My day-to-day role involved designing, building, and maintaining the infrastructure to operate
                        servers and services in one of Stripe's most critical and secure environments, at scale (RPS in
                        the tens of thousands). This required managing large-scale projects involving multiple teams
                        across several offices and timezones, ensuring that each stakeholder understood the project
                        requirements and desired outcomes.
                    </p>

                    <p class="mb-6 text-xl leading-loose">
                        In my 2+ years at the company, I managed the migration of our services from manually configured
                        AWS EC2 instances to fully auto-scaled clusters in regions across the world, built a
                        PCI-compliant secrets management system, and designed a multi-threaded Go service responsible
                        for safely terminating EC2 instances serving production traffic for every service at Stripe.
                        Each of these projects required input and engineering effort from several teams, which I oversaw
                        the work for to ensure it lined up with what was expected by my team and the project stakeholders.
                    </p>

                    <p class="mb-6 text-xl leading-loose">
                        In addition to this technical experience, I have led and improved Stripe's annual PCI audit
                        process, managed projects across teams spanning several offices with engineers from a variety of
                        backgrounds, and worked with financial partners to enable Stripe's expansion into new countries.

                        During my 3+ years at the creative agency, I worked my way from an entry-level full stack
                        position to a senior position where I was responsible for crafting the highest quality sites and
                        apps as well as setting org-wide standards and leading projects across marketing and development
                        teams.

                   <p class="mb-6 text-xl leading-loose">

                        website redesign, where I was equally involved in the code as I was working directly with the
                        marketing and design teams to ensure we were pushing the boundaries beyond what a client such as
                        Virgin expected us to. The result was a highly interactive website with parallax floating
                        elements, discovery sections, and an immersive storyline that was revolutionary for its era
                        (2018) and stands the test of time to this day.

                        mixture of marketing sites and web applications.
